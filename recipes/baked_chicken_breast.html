    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Breasts
        Of course, you'll need chicken breasts. This recipe calls for four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.
        <br>
        Olive Oil
        Olive oil provides moisture and prevents the chicken breasts from drying out. It also helps the chicken cook more evenly.
        <br>
        Salt
        Use your favorite coarse sea salt for the most delicious results.
        <br>
        Creole Seasoning
        Creole seasoning adds flavor and a bit of welcome heat.
        <br>
        Chicken Broth
        You'll use chicken broth to make an easy pan sauce to pour over the baked chicken.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>

    <h2>How to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
